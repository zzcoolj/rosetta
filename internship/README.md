You can read this [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J93-1004.pdf) or try to find some blogs/videos explaning this algorithm. You don't need to understand all the details about it. But you should know how to use it.
2. Play the Gale-Church algorithm by using [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/align/gale_church.html) in Python. Checking out an example [here](references/parallel-gale-church.ipynb).
