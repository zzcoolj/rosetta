	before:
		I had wore the ground a good deal, crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there,-for it was bent up at that place, and didn't quite touch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't ever notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin and it warn't likely anybody would go fooling around there.

Ode to Stephen Dowling Bots, Dec'd.
####### 17 ########

####### 17 ########
And did young Stephen sicken,
####### 17 ########
And did young Stephen die?
####### 17 ########
And did the sad hearts thicken,
####### 17 ########
And did the mourners cry?
####### 17 ########

####### 17 ########
No; such was not the fate of
####### 17 ########
Young Stephen Dowling Bots;
####### 17 ########
Though sad hearts round him thickened,
####### 17 ########
'Twas not from sickness' shots.
####### 17 ########

####### 17 ########
No whooping-cough did rack his frame,
####### 17 ########
Nor measles drear, with spots;
####### 17 ########
Not these impaired the sacred name
####### 17 ########
Of Stephen Dowling Bots.
####### 17 ########
Despised love struck not with woe
####### 17 ########
That head of curly knots,
####### 17 ########
Nor stomach troubles laid him low,
####### 17 ########
Young Stephen Dowling Bots.
####### 17 ########

####### 17 ########
O no. Then list with tearful eye,
####### 17 ########
Whilst I his fate do tell.
####### 17 ########
His soul did from this cold world fly,
####### 17 ########
By falling down a well.
####### 17 ########

####### 17 ########
They got him out and emptied him;
####### 17 ########
Alas it was too late;
####### 17 ########
His spirit was gone for to sport aloft
####### 17 ########
In the realms of the good and great.
####### 17 ########
</p>
####### 21 ########
<p>To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin
####### 21 ########
That makes calamity of so long life;
####### 21 ########
For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane,
####### 21 ########
But that the fear of something after death
####### 21 ########
Murders the innocent sleep,
####### 21 ########
Great nature's second course,
####### 21 ########
And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune
####### 21 ########
Than fly to others that we know not of.
####### 21 ########
There's the respect must give us pause:
####### 21 ########
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst;
####### 21 ########
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
####### 21 ########
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
####### 21 ########
The law's delay, and the quietus which his pangs might take,
####### 21 ########
In the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn
####### 21 ########
In customary suits of solemn black,
####### 21 ########
But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,
####### 21 ########
Breathes forth contagion on the world,
####### 21 ########
And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i' the adage,
####### 21 ########
Is sicklied o'er with care,
####### 21 ########
And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops,
####### 21 ########
With this regard their currents turn awry,
####### 21 ########
And lose the name of action.
####### 21 ########
'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the fair Ophelia:
####### 21 ########
Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws,
####### 21 ########
But get thee to a nunnery—go!</p>
