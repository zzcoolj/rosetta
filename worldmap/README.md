# Web Development Notes
## General Information
### [GLOBAL HUCK Website, not up to date](https://rosetta.univ-lille.fr/worldmap/)
### Goals
The goal of the World Map is to create a beautiful and functional global display of translations.
### Existing Features:
- Three types of bubbles on the map: blue for well-resourced languages, orange for medium-resourced languages and red for low resourced-languages.
- Mouseover bubbles for general information.
- The bigger green bubble in Brazil’s position is clickable: You gonna get a menu with 4 translators with the corresponding book cover and description at the bottom of the page. Changing the cover and the description by clicking different translators name. Hide all by clicking other bubbles.
## Tasks
