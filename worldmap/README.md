# Web development notes
## General information
### [GLOBAL HUCK Website](https://rosetta.univ-lille.fr/worldmap/)
### Features we already have:
- Three types of bubbles on the map: blue for well-resourced languages, orange for medium-resourced languages and red for low resourced-languages.
- Mouseover bubbles for general information
- The bigger green bubble in Brazilâ€™s position is clickable: You gonna get a menu with 4 translators with the corresponding book cover and description at the bottom of the page. Changing the cover and the description by clicking different translators name. Hide all by clicking other bubbles.
### Goal
- For the data visualization part, we want to have a website as beautiful and functional as the [The translation routes](https://routes-traductions.huma-num.fr) website.
- For the interactive part, it should accept user input. [LATER]
